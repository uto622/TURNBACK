ensure clarity, safety, and sustainability of the project.

## What You Can Contribute

You are welcome to contribute:

- Issue reports using the TURNBACK Issue Template
- Improvements to issue taxonomy definitions
- Signal detection heuristics (rules or reference implementations)
- Documentation clarifications
- Tooling for report generation or routing
- Examples of sanitized, reproducible interaction failures

## What You Should NOT Contribute

Please do **not** submit:

- Raw or unsanitized private conversations
- Personally identifying information (PII) of any individual
- Content that violates applicable laws in your jurisdiction
- Political advocacy, moderation rules, or alignment policies

TURNBACK is **not** a data collection platform.

## Privacy & Responsibility

By contributing to TURNBACK, you acknowledge that:

- You are responsible for ensuring submitted content is lawful
- You are responsible for sanitizing or redacting sensitive data
- TURNBACK maintainers do not validate legal compliance

TURNBACK provides **schemas and tooling**, not data governance.

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

When submitting an issue:

- Use the provided GitHub Issue Template
- Clearly describe expected vs actual behavior
- Provide minimal reproduction steps
- Include only sanitized evidence
- Focus on interaction failures, not opinions

Issues that do not follow the template may be closed without review.

## Code Contributions

- Keep implementations minimal and explainable
- Prefer rule-based or interpretable logic for signal detection
- Avoid dependencies that require proprietary services
- Document assumptions and limitations clearly

## Project Philosophy

TURNBACK exists to improve **human–AI interaction dignity**,
not to enforce ideology, alignment doctrine, or control systems.

Contributions that attempt to shift the project outside its defined scope
may be declined.
